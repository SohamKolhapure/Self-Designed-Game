**STORY**: A boy name Sam had visited a fair and played a game of bow and arrow, and when he came to his city, he asked his father to make a game of archery, so the father asked a programmer(**i.e.YOU**) to make a game for his son.

**Archery** is a game of bow and arrow.
 In this game I will be making a bow, some arrows and a target board, and after the game is over  there will be a virtual image of victory based on the  total score obtained.
 the player only has to release the arrow and the arrow should touch the target board.
 
 **Objects : BOW, ARROW, Targetboard**
